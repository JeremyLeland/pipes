- Make canvas better fill available area with the desired bounds
  - Current zoom/scroll is awkward
  - Can we define desired bounds?
      - Or maybe center x/y and width/height?
  - Then we should scale as appropriate to fit all of bounds into available area, with whatever zoom needed
- Make playable basic Pipe Dream, branch it, put it on website
  - Then work on better version
  - More like the hacking in Bioshock
  - Make a maze of pipes, then rotate them all randomly
  - Instead of placing pipes from list, rotate them by clicking
  - I think this is more fun than basic Pipe Dream gameplay
